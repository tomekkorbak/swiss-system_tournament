# swiss-system_tournament
Swiss-system tournament (a PostgreSQL project)

This is the final project of "Intro to relational databases" course at Udacity.

The game tournament will use [the Swiss system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament) for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible. Players and matches are stored in a PostgreSQL database.
